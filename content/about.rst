About
=====

Hello,

my name is Rafael Martins and this is my place for rants, random videos and any
other stupid content that I may want to publish and share.

For useful stuff please go to http://rafaelmartins.eng.br/.

My "official" blog is indexed by some serious feed aggregators. I don't want to
write useless content there.

And yes, I'm writing in English, to improve my (not so good) skills. Please
don't be too picky. :)


About the blog domain
---------------------

No, I don't live in the Isle of Man (although I want to visit it, preferably
during the `Tourist Trophy`_) neither work on any instant messaging related
project. This is just one of the few domains available with my surname, that is
quite common in Brazil. :)
